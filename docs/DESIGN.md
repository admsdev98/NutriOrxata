# Design Principles

## Product Interaction Principles

- Mobile-first for all user journeys.
- Common actions in 2-3 clicks.
- Calm, task-focused surfaces over dashboard noise.
- Dense worker surfaces without excessive scrolling.
- Light and dark mode support across key views.

## Worker UX Direction

- Prioritize split panes, tabs, and sticky contextual actions.
- Prefer inline edits over modal chains.
- Every empty state must include a clear next action.
- Make state transitions explicit (active, read-only, blocked).

## Client UX Direction

- Keep daily experience simple and action-first.
- Focus on plan adherence, logging, and communication.
- Hide worker-only complexity.

## Design Governance

- Changes to core interaction patterns must update `docs/design-docs/`.
- UI behavior changes must update `docs/product-specs/`.
