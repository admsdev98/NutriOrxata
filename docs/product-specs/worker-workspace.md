# Worker Workspace

## Goal

Enable workers to complete core daily planning actions quickly.

## Primary Surfaces

- Clients list
- Client workspace tabs
- Nutrition targets
- Weekly planning
- Training assignment
- Messaging
- Progress view

## UX Constraints

- Reach common actions in 2-3 clicks.
- Keep worker surfaces dense but calm.
- Avoid heavy scroll and nested modal workflows.

## Access Constraints

- Read-only mode allows viewing and export/delete safety actions.
- Mutating operations are blocked in read-only mode.
