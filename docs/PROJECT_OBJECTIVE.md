# Project Objective

## Name

NutriOrxata (temporary name).

## What it is

NutriOrxata is a client-management and planning platform for:

- Nutritionists and personal trainers who are starting out.
- Professionals with low or limited budget.

It replaces per-client spreadsheets with a single app that centralizes data and workflows.

## Primary goals

- Make day-to-day client management fast and simple.
- Build reusable libraries (ingredients, dishes, routines) to reduce repeated work.
- Give clients a simple app to follow plans, log progress, and communicate.

## Target users

### Worker (professional)

- Has multiple clients (online and/or in-person).
- Needs fast planning, low admin overhead, and reusable content.
- Wants a lightweight system that does not feel like enterprise software.

### Client

- Wants clarity: what to eat, what to train, what is left today/this week.
- Needs tracking without spreadsheets.

## Value proposition

- One place for client data (profile, goals, weekly plan, routines, messages).
- Reusable content libraries that can be adapted per client.
- Clear weekly planning with minimal friction.

## What success looks like (measurable)

- Worker can onboard a new client in <= 10 minutes.
- Worker can assign a full week plan in <= 5 minutes using templates.
- Client opens the app and immediately knows:
  - Today: meals + training.
  - Progress: calories/macros and goal progress.
  - Next action: log / message / complete workout.

## Non-goals (for now)

- Full medical EHR features.
- Advanced meal photo recognition.
- Full payment/subscription system inside the app (can be later).
- Social network features.

## Constraints

- Mobile-first.
- Low-click, low-scroll.
- Light/dark modes.
- Keep UX calm: no unnecessary widgets.

Trust constraints:

- Data export and deletion must be available to the worker at all times.
- Access gates (verification/trial) must be explained calmly.
