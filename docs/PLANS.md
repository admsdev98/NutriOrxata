# Plans and Roadmap Execution

This file is the roadmap gateway for execution.

## Planning Model

- Roadmap is translated into sprint-sized tasks.
- Each sprint is small-medium scope and reversible.
- Each sprint must include docs updates for behavior changes.

## Active Execution Queue

1. S00 - Documentation harness and architecture map
2. S01 - Auth and access gate hardening
3. S02 - Tenant enforcement and indexing baseline
4. S03 - Worker workspace shell
5. S04 - Nutrition inputs and targets
6. S05 - Food library and dish templates
7. S06 - Weekly planning and plan instances
8. S07 - Training flows and logs
9. S08 - Messaging and media constraints
10. S09 - Progress tracking and retention flows
11. S10 - Reliability and deployment hardening
12. S11 - Continuous quality and tech debt reduction
