# Agent Operating Model

## Principle

Humans steer intent and constraints. Agents execute implementation and iteration.

## Repository Legibility Rules

- Keep architecture boundaries explicit and documented.
- Keep docs discoverable through short indexes.
- Keep decisions and plans versioned in repository.

## Enforcement Focus

- Enforce invariants mechanically where possible.
- Keep lint/test/check output understandable for agents.
- Prefer deterministic, explicit implementation patterns.
